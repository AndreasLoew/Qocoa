Qocoa
=====

Qocoa is a collection of Qt wrappers for OSX's Cocoa widgets.

They have the following features/goals:

- basic fallback to sensible Qt types on non-OSX platforms
- shared class headers which expose no implementation details
- typical Qt signal/slot-based API
- trivial to import into projects (class header/implementation,[single shared global header](https://github.com/mikemcquaid/Qocoa/blob/master/qocoa_mac.h))
